Apologies for the previous suggestions. Here's another independent project idea in C that involves data structures and algorithms and is relevant:

Project: Online Bookstore Management System

Description:
Create a management system for an online bookstore that allows users to browse, search, and purchase books. The system should efficiently handle a large number of books using appropriate data structures and implement algorithms for efficient searching and sorting.

Requirements:
2. Data Structure Selection: Choose appropriate data structures for storing and managing books efficiently. Consider using data structures like hash tables, binary search trees, or balanced search trees for efficient searching and retrieval.

3. File I/O: Implement functionality to read book information from a file at the start of the  program and update the file with changes made during the program execution. This ensures the bookstore inventory is persistent.

4. Searching: Implement efficient search algorithms (e.g., binary search or hash-based search) to allow users to search for books by title, author, or genre.

5. Sorting: Implement sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quicksort, or heapsort) to sort books based on various criteria such as title, author, or price.

6. Book Operations: Implement operations such as adding a new book, deleting an existing book, searching for a book by title or author, updating book information, and maintaining book availability.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
7. User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface to interact with the online bookstore system. Users should be able to browse books, search for books, add books to a shopping cart, and complete the purchase process.

8. Error Handling: Implement proper error handling to handle scenarios such as invalid user inputs, book not found, out-of-stock books, or file read/write errors.

9. Efficiency Optimization: Analyze the performance of your implemented algorithms and data structures. Identify bottlenecks and find ways to optimize the code for better time or space complexity.

10. Documentation: Create a documentation file that explains how to run the program, its features, and any additional instructions or dependencies.

Tips:
- Break down the project into smaller tasks and allocate time accordingly.
- Test your code frequently during development to catch and fix bugs early.
- Consider adding additional features, such as user account management, book recommendations, or reviews and ratings.

Remember to manage your time effectively and prioritize implementing efficient data structures and algorithms. This project will provide you with valuable experience in handling large datasets and optimizing performance. Good luck with your project!


For points 2 and 3:
Read from File
Create the AVL Tree



avl tree used
Using a file to input and output to when the program is not running
Can improve the efficency of the rebalance algorithm



functions grouped in different module files

each book is a struct seperate from the avl tree which points to the book struct
