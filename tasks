Apologies for the previous suggestions. Here's another independent project idea in C that involves data structures and algorithms and is relevant:

Project: Online Bookstore Management System

Description:
Create a management system for an online bookstore that allows users to browse, search, and purchase books. The system should efficiently handle a large number of books using appropriate data structures and implement algorithms for efficient searching and sorting.

Requirements:
2. Data Structure Selection: Choose appropriate data structures for storing and managing books efficiently. Consider using data structures like hash tables, binary search trees, or balanced search trees for efficient searching and retrieval.

3. File I/O: Implement functionality to read book information from a file at the start of the  program and update the file with changes made during the program execution. This ensures the bookstore inventory is persistent.

4. Searching: Implement efficient search algorithms (e.g., binary search or hash-based search) to allow users to search for books by title, author, or genre.

5. Sorting: Implement sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quicksort, or heapsort) to sort books based on various criteria such as title, author, or price.

6. Book Operations: Implement operations such as adding a new book, deleting an existing book, searching for a book by title or author, updating book information, and maintaining book availability.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
7. User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface to interact with the online bookstore system. Users should be able to browse books, search for books, add books to a shopping cart, and complete the purchase process.

8. Error Handling: Implement proper error handling to handle scenarios such as invalid user inputs, book not found, out-of-stock books, or file read/write errors.

9. Efficiency Optimization: Analyze the performance of your implemented algorithms and data structures. Identify bottlenecks and find ways to optimize the code for better time or space complexity.

10. Documentation: Create a documentation file that explains how to run the program, its features, and any additional instructions or dependencies.

Tips:
- Break down the project into smaller tasks and allocate time accordingly.
- Test your code frequently during development to catch and fix bugs early.
- Consider adding additional features, such as user account management, book recommendations, or reviews and ratings.

Remember to manage your time effectively and prioritize implementing efficient data structures and algorithms. This project will provide you with valuable experience in handling large datasets and optimizing performance. Good luck with your project!


For points 2 and 3:
Read from File
Create the AVL Tree



avl tree used
Using a file to input and output to when the program is not running
Can improve the efficency of the rebalance algorithm



functions grouped in different module files

each book is a struct seperate from the avl tree which points to the book struct








//  
using raygui for the UI frontend, fixed size of 1280 x 720 so as to avoid resizing issues. Took up raygui for its simplicity. Initilly thought of gTK
dropped UI. Will be doing it on CUI only.

the readme file will have all the codes for genres and and title lenghts.

wrote a custom fgetS function so that we know the current first char  of the buffer

//Improvements could have been made
check for existing conflicting names / ISBN 
Encryption and decryption of files
sorting while listing and sorting according to various parameters


one of the goals here was to also write clean code

clearing buffer is the responsibility of the function / section calling it
